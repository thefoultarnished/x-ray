*   <img src="assets/globe.svg" width="16" height="16" align="center"> **Country Flags** - Visual representation with country flags
*   **Quick Copy** - One-click copy to clipboard

**100% FREE. Unlimited usage. No subscriptions. No tracking.**

## Features

### Click-to-Reveal Design
Unlike other extensions that auto-load everything, X-Ray uses a **smart click-to-reveal** system. This protects your account from Twitter/X's aggressive rate limits while giving you full control over what data you fetch.

**Why click-to-reveal?**
*   **Prevents rate limiting** - Twitter/X has strict API limits. Auto-loading hundreds of profiles would get you blocked
*   **Protects your account** - No unnecessary requests = safer browsing
*   **Faster performance** - Only loads what you actually want to see
*   **Smart caching** - Once loaded, data is cached for instant re-display

### Beautiful Interface
*   Sleek, modern design that blends seamlessly with Twitter/X
*   Smooth animations and hover effects
*   Color-coded platforms (iOS blue, Android green)
*   Glassmorphic styling with rotating borders

### Privacy-First
*   **Zero data collection** - We don't track, store, or transmit anything
*   **Local storage only** - All data stays in your browser session
*   **No external servers** - Everything runs locally
*   **Open source** - Full transparency, audit the code yourself

### Performance Optimized
*   DNS prefetch for faster flag loading
*   Smart caching system
*   Efficient DOM manipulation
*   Minimal resource footprint

## How It Works

1.  **Browse Twitter/X normally** - Extension adds a small location icon <img src="assets/pin.svg" width="16" height="16" align="center"> next to usernames
2.  **Click the location icon** - Instantly loads the user's public location data
3.  **View the info** - See their location with country flag and platform (iOS/Android/Web)
4.  **Copy if needed** - Click the location pill to copy to clipboard

**That's it!** Simple, fast, and effective.

## Why Click-to-Reveal?

### The Problem with Auto-Loading
Many extensions automatically fetch data for every user you see. This causes:
*   **Rate limit bans** - Twitter/X blocks excessive requests
*   **Account suspension risk** - Automated behavior triggers security flags
*   **Slow performance** - Loading hundreds of profiles kills your browser
*   **Wasted bandwidth** - Fetching data you don't need

### Our Solution
X-Ray's **click-to-reveal** approach means:
*   **You stay safe** - Only fetch what you need, when you need it
*   **No rate limits** - Controlled, manual requests don't trigger Twitter's defenses
*   **Blazing fast** - Instant response with smart caching
*   **Full control** - You decide what to reveal

## Technical Details

### Built With
*   **Manifest V3** - Latest Chrome extension standard
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, pure performance
*   **CSS3 Animations** - Smooth, GPU-accelerated effects
*   **Modern Web APIs** - Clipboard, MutationObserver, etc.

### Permissions Explained
*   **`declarativeNetRequest`** - Required to access profile data by temporarily removing frame-blocking headers

### How It Works Technically

**No APIs. No servers. Just smart web scraping of public data.**
